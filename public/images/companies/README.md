# Company Logos for Ark Page

This directory is for storing company logo images used in the Ark page of your personal website.

## Instructions for Adding Logos

1. Prepare your logo images:
   - Use PNG format with transparent background for best results
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
   - Keep file sizes small (under 100KB if possible) for better performance
   - Use consistent styling (either all colored logos or all monochrome)

2. Name your files according to the pattern in the Ark.jsx file:
   - tesla.png
   - spacex.png
   - microsoft.png
   - etc.

3. Place all logo files directly in this directory.

4. For best visual results in both dark and light modes:
   - For dark mode: Use white or light-colored logos with transparent backgrounds
   - For light mode: Use black or dark-colored logos with transparent backgrounds
   - Alternatively, use a single version that works well on both backgrounds

## Default Behavior

If a logo file is missing, the Ark page will display the first letter of the company name in a circular badge as a fallback.
