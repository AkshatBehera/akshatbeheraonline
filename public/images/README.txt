PROFILE IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Save your profile image in this directory as "profile.jpg"
2. The image should be high resolution for best results (recommended size: at least 1920x1080 pixels)
3. The black and white portrait image you shared in the conversation is now set as the website background
4. The image will automatically appear as the background for the entire website with a dark overlay to ensure text readability

Note: If you prefer a different filename or format, you'll need to update the image path in:
- src/styles/index.css (look for the background-image property)
